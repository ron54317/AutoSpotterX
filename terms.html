            <h2>AutoSpotterX – Terms of Service</h2>
            <p><em>Last Updated: December 21, 2025</em></p>

            <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
            <p>By using AutoSpotterX ("the App"), you're agreeing to these Terms of Service. If you don't agree, please
                don't use the App. Your use is also governed by our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

            <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
            <p>AutoSpotterX is a mobile application that allows car enthusiasts to spot, document, and share real-world
                automotive sightings. The app provides a vehicle database with rarity classification, personal
                collection management, social features (including friends, likes, public feed, and country spots),
                private mapping for your own spots, and gamification features (AutoXP points and leaderboards).</p>

            <p><strong>AI Identification:</strong> Optional AI-powered car identification. Each account receives one
                free use. We track your usage count to enforce free usage limits. Additional uses may require payment in
                the future. AI results may be inaccurate—do not rely on
                them for legal or commercial purposes.</p>

            <p>We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue any feature at any time without notice. The
                Service is provided "as is" without guarantees of availability or error-free operation.</p>

            <h2>3. User Accounts</h2>
            <p>You must be at least 16 years old (age may vary by local law) to use the App. Users under the minimum age
                are not allowed to create an account.</p>

            <p>Please provide accurate information when creating your account and keep it secure. You're responsible for
                all activity under your account.

            <h2>4. User Content</h2>
            <p>You are solely responsible for all content you upload or share through the App. You must make
                sure your content is legal, does not infringe on anyone else's rights (including privacy and copyright),
                and complies with all applicable laws.</p>

            <p>You own your content. By uploading content to the App, you grant AutoSpotterX a non-exclusive, worldwide,
                royalty-free, revocable license to store, display, and process your content to operate, improve, and
                promote the App.
                If you share content publicly, it may be used in AutoSpotterX-related promotional materials. You can opt
                out at any time by disabling public sharing in your privacy settings (Settings → Privacy → “Don’t Upload
                to Feed & Country Spots”) or hiding individual cars.
                You retain all copyright and ownership of your content.</p>
            <p>We do not actively monitor all content and are not responsible for content posted by users. However, we
                reserve the right (but are not obligated) to review, remove, or report any content that we believe
                violates these Terms or any applicable law.</p>

            <p><strong>Content Rules:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Original photos only:</strong> Upload only photos you personally took. No internet
                    downloads, screenshots, stock photos, AI-generated images, or content taken from other apps or
                    websites.</li>
                <li><strong>Real Cars only:</strong> Upload only real cars spotted in the real world. No toy cars or
                    video
                    game screenshots.</li>
                <li><strong>Blur license plates and faces:</strong> The App attempts to automatically blur license
                    plates
                    and faces, but it may not be perfect. You must review your photos before upload and blur any visible
                    license plates or faces yourself (use the in-app Blur tool). You are responsible for any privacy
                    violations.</li>
                <li><strong>No personal or sensitive data:</strong> Avoid capturing people, home addresses, or other
                    personal identifiers.</li>
                <li><strong>Respect private property:</strong> Do not enter private areas or capture photos through
                    gates/garages where there is an expectation of privacy.</li>
                <li><strong>Clear visibility:</strong> Photos must clearly show the car. Extremely blurry, dark, or
                    obstructed photos may be removed.</li>
                <li><strong>Accurate information:</strong> Provide correct vehicle details and do not impersonate other
                    people or misrepresent ownership or authorship of photos.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Privacy Protection:</strong> AutoSpotterX may automatically blur license plates and faces, but
                automatic detection may not be perfect. You are responsible for reviewing your photos before uploading
                and using the in-app Blur tool to blur any remaining sensitive information.</p>

            <p><strong>Content Visibility:</strong> Common cars are not accepted. Uncommon cars are stored privately.
                Only RARE+ cars can appear in the feed and country spots if your privacy settings allow it.</p>

            <p><strong>Originality Detection:</strong> We use metadata to detect non-original photos. If detected, they
                won't appear in the feed or country spots but will be stored in your private collection. We may delete
                photos determined to be not original.</p>

            <h2>5. Prohibited Conduct</h2>
            <p>To keep AutoSpotterX safe and fair for everyone, please don't:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Upload photos from the internet, screenshots, AI images, or content you didn't personally create
                </li>
                <li>Upload content that contains nudity, pornography, or sexually explicit material</li>
                <li>Upload images of violence, abuse, self-harm, or illegal activity</li>
                <li>Post offensive, discriminatory, or hate-based content</li>
                <li>Use copyrighted material without permission or upload content you do not have the right to upload
                </li>
                <li>Upload photos with visible license plates or faces (unless they are properly blurred)</li>
                <li>Take photos on private property without permission</li>
                <li>Impersonate any person or entity, or mislead others about your identity or affiliation</li>
                <li>Use the App while driving or in dangerous situations</li>
                <li>Try to hack, reverse engineer, or otherwise tamper with the App or our services</li>
                <li>Use the App for commercial purposes without our written approval</li>
                <li>Harass, bully, or abuse other users</li>
                <li>Create multiple accounts to get around restrictions or bans</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Safety First:</strong> You're responsible for your own safety when using the App. Please don't
                trespass or put yourself or others in danger. Stay safe and follow all traffic laws.</p>
            <p>If these rules are violated, we may need to remove content or suspend accounts to keep the community
                safe.</p>

            <h2>6. Content Moderation</h2>
            <p>While we do not manually review every photo, we reserve the right to review flagged content, remove
                inappropriate or non-compliant content, and terminate or restrict access for repeat or severe
                violations.</p>
            <p>We may remove cars that violate these Terms or don't meet our requirements. Content can be removed if
                administrators see violations or if users report it. Accounts that repeatedly violate these Terms may be
                suspended or terminated.</p>
            <p>If administrators delete your content for policy violations, we will notify you via an in-app
                notification.</p>
            <p>You can report content through the in-app reporting feature.</p>

            <h2>6A. Copyright Complaints</h2>
            <p>If you believe someone uploaded content that infringes your copyright, trademark, or other intellectual
                property rights, you may submit a copyright complaint by emailing us at <a
                    href="mailto:zernoxi6@gmail.com">zernoxi6@gmail.com</a> with "Copyright Complaint" in the subject
                line.</p>

            <p>Your notice must include: (1) your contact information (name, address, phone, email), (2) identification
                of the copyrighted work claimed to be infringed, (3) identification of the infringing material (link or
                clear description), (4) a statement that you have a good faith belief the use is not authorized, (5) a
                statement that the information is accurate and you are authorized to act for the rights holder, and (6)
                your physical or electronic signature.</p>

            <p>We'll review your notice and remove infringing content if appropriate. Repeat offenders may have their
                accounts suspended or terminated.</p>

            <h2>7. Privacy</h2>
            <p>Your privacy is important. Our data practices are governed by our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy
                    Policy</a>. We implement security measures but cannot guarantee
                absolute security.</p>

            <h2>8. Intellectual Property</h2>
            <p>All car brand names, logos, and trademarks (for example, Ferrari, Lamborghini) belong to their respective
                owners and are used in the App only for descriptive purposes. AutoSpotterX is not affiliated with or
                endorsed by any vehicle manufacturer.</p>
            <p>Any logos or trademarks visible in uploaded photos are incidental and part of user-generated content. If
                you are a rights holder and believe your intellectual property is being misused within the App, you may
                submit a copyright complaint (see Section 6A) or contact us at <a
                    href="mailto:zernoxi6@gmail.com">zernoxi6@gmail.com</a>.</p>

            <p>Any feedback, suggestions, or ideas you submit to AutoSpotterX are provided voluntarily and may be used
                by us for any purpose, without compensation or obligation to you.</p>

            <h2>10. Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>The App uses third-party services (cloud storage, AI, etc.) that have their own terms. We're not
                responsible for their availability, accuracy, security, or failures.</p>

            <p>The App may link to external websites—we don't control those sites.</p>

            <h2>11. Service Availability and Modifications</h2>
            <p>We do our best to keep the App running smoothly, but we can't guarantee it'll be available 24/7 or
                completely error-free. We may need to update, modify, or temporarily suspend features for maintenance or
                improvements.</p>

            <p>We reserve the right to make changes to the App or these Terms as needed. If we make significant changes
                to the Terms, we'll update the "Last Updated" date and notify you through the App or email. Continuing
                to use the App after changes means you accept them.</p>
