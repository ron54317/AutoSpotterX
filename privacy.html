            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>AutoSpotterX ("we," "our," or "us") values your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect,
                use, and protect your information when you use the AutoSpotterX mobile app (available on Google Play).
                It applies to all users of the app and covers the data collected through the app.</p>

            <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>We collect the following types of information:</p>

            <p><strong>Account & Profile Data:</strong> Username, optional profile photo, account creation date, and
                AutoXP
                points (which determine your public XP rank badge displayed to other users). Authentication is handled
                by Firebase Authentication (email/password or Google
                sign-in). We also store a unique account identifier (Firebase UID) and whether you accepted our Terms of
                Service and Privacy Policy (including the current version). Your email address is used only for
                authentication.</p>

            <p><strong>User Content:</strong> We collect the following user-generated content:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Photos & Videos:</strong> Main vehicle photos (uploaded to our servers). Secondary photos
                    and videos are stored only on your device and never uploaded.</li>
                <li><strong>Car Details:</strong> Make/model, captions/notes, timestamps, and country name/code (derived
                    from location).</li>
                <li><strong>Privacy Settings:</strong> Your sharing preferences for the public feed and Country Spots.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Social Interactions:</strong> Likes, friend connections/requests, and in-app notifications.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Moderation:</strong> Reports you submit for content moderation.</li>
                <li><strong>AI Usage:</strong> Service usage counts to enforce rate limits.</li>
                <li><strong>Photo Metadata:</strong> We analyze EXIF data (location, camera info, timestamps) locally on
                    your device for originality detection. Precise location stays on your device only. We only collect
                    country name/code for our servers.</li>
                <li><strong>Photo Processing:</strong> Car photos are processed on-device before upload (watermarking,
                    privacy blurring, manual blurring). We upload only processed versions, not originals. Low-quality
                    versions are stored in Firebase; high-quality versions may be stored on Cloudinary for public
                    sharing (if eligible and not hidden). Secondary photos and videos never leave your device.</li>
            </ul>


            <p><strong>Device & Usage Data:</strong> Technical data from your device, such as device model and operating
                system version, to ensure compatibility and diagnose issues. We may also collect usage statistics to
                improve the app.</p>

            <p><strong>App Permissions:</strong> Camera (to take photos), Location
                (for mapping features), Internet (for cloud sync), and Network State (to check connectivity). The app
                saves photos and data within app storage and does not request a storage permission. You can
                change or revoke permissions through your device settings.</p>

            <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
            <p>We share specific data in limited scenarios as described below:</p>

            <h3>5.1 Service Providers</h3>
            <p>We engage third-party service providers to facilitate our services:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Firebase (Google):</strong>For user authentication, database storage, and backend services.
                    As our primary backend, Firebase stores all app data described in Section 2, except for GPS

            </ul>

            <h3>5.2 Public & Social Features</h3>
            <p>Information shared with other users through the app's social features:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Public Feed:</strong> Eligible spots (RARE+ rarity, original) appear in the public feed
                    unless you enable "Don't Upload to Feed & Country Spots" or hide individual spots. The feed
                    displays: car photos, profile photos, usernames, car names, likes, rank badges, country, and
                    optional captions. Content shared publicly may be used for promotional purposes. Exact location is
                    never shared, only country (see Section 5.4).</li>
                <li><strong>Country Spots:</strong> Users can browse RARE+ cars by country. Displays only car photos and
                    car names no username or profile info. Only country name shown, no exact location. Only RARE+ cars
                    not hidden from public sharing appear here.</li>
                <li><strong>Leaderboard:</strong> Public leaderboard shows top 50 users by AutoXP (username, AutoXP
                    points, profile photo).</li>
                <li><strong>Friends:</strong> Friends can see all cars in your collection (car photos and make/model)
                    but not exact locations.</li>
                <li><strong>Friend Requests:</strong> When you send a friend request (via feed or leaderboard), the
                    recipient can see your display name and profile photo in the Friends screen and may receive a
                    notification (e.g., "[Your username] sent you a friend request"). User IDs are internal only.</li>
                <li><strong>Like Notifications:</strong> When you like someone's car, they may receive an in-app
                    notification showing your username and the car details (e.g., "[Your username] liked your Ferrari
                    F40").</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>5.3 Legal & Administrative</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Administrators:</strong> Administrators may access user data (photos, profile info, content)
                    for moderation and support. They can delete content that violates our Terms of Service. Deleted
                    content is permanently removed from our servers (Firestore and Cloudinary), and users are notified
                    via in-app notification.</li>
                <li><strong>Law and Safety:</strong> We may disclose your information if required by law or to protect
                    our rights, safety, or property.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>5.4 Map and Location Privacy</h3>
            <p>Your location privacy is fully protected:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Device-Only Storage:</strong> GPS coordinates are stored only on your device in
                    SharedPreferences.
                    They are designed to be stored only on your device and are not uploaded to our servers. Deleted when
                    you uninstall the app or delete your account.</li>
                <li><strong>Location Attachment Control:</strong> You can control whether location data is attached to
                    your spots through Settings → Privacy → "Attach Location by Default". When disabled, the app will
                    not extract or store location data from your photos. This setting is enabled by default but can be
                    turned off at any time.</li>
                <li><strong>Country Data Only:</strong> To enable Country Spots browsing and show which country a car
                    was
                    spotted in inside the feed, we extract country name/code from coordinates using Android Geocoder
                    (device geocoding
                    service). Only country name/code is stored on our servers exact coordinates are not.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Completely Private:</strong> Only you can see exact locations on your personal map. Friends
                    can see your car photos/details but not locations or map markers.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>6. Your Rights and Controls</h2>
            <p>You have control over your personal data and account. You can view and update your profile information,
                delete your photos or entries, request data export, manage friends, control app permissions through
                device settings, choose not to upload your spots to the public feed and Country Spots, and manage
                optional features (such as location attachment and cloud AI identification).</p>
            <p><strong>Data Export:</strong>You can export your data through app settings in a ZIP file, including your
                profile, cars and media (with location, photos, and videos), friends, notifications, and AI usage
                counts.</p>

            <h2>7. Account and Data Deletion</h2>
            <p>You can delete your entire account through app settings (requires recent login within 5 minutes for
                security; deleted promptly (typically within minutes))
                or by emailing us at zernoxi6@gmail.com with "Account Deletion" in the subject line (deleted within 7
                working days). All personal data will be permanently deleted, except for limited data we are legally
                required to retain (such as anonymized logs), which will be retained only for as long as required by
                law. Deleting individual photos or entries
                removes that content from our servers immediately. Deletion covers all personal data including profile
                info, photos, videos, car collection details, friend connections, and activity logs.</p>
            <p><strong>Administrative Deletion:</strong> Content may also be deleted by administrators if it violates
                our Terms of Service. When administrators delete your content for policy violations, it is permanently
                removed from our servers (Firestore and Cloudinary). You will be notified via in-app notification if
                your content is deleted for policy violations.</p>

            <h2>8. Additional (Optional) Features</h2>
            <p>AutoSpotterX offers several optional features with extra privacy considerations:</p>

            <p><strong>Local Video Storage:</strong> If you record car videos within the app, they are stored only on
                your device in encrypted form. These videos are designed to remain on your device and are not uploaded
                or shared externally.
                Deleting the associated car entry or your account will erase these videos.</p>

            <p><strong>Cloud AI Identification:</strong> As mentioned in Section 3, the optional Google Gemini service
                can analyze car photos. This is an opt-in feature: you must choose to send a photo to Google for
                identification. Only the image is sent (no personal data). Data handling is subject to Google's Privacy
                Policy. We track your usage count in Firebase to enforce free usage limits.</p>

            <p><strong>Social Sharing:</strong> Friends, the public feed, and Country Spots sharing are described in
                Section 5. You can stop sharing cars to the public feed and Country Spots at any time by enabling the
                global privacy setting in Settings ("Don't Upload to Feed & Country Spots" ). You can also hide
                individual spots from public sharing when saving a car ("Hide from Feed").</p>

            <h2>9. Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>You must be at least 16 years old to use AutoSpotterX (age may vary by local law). We do not knowingly
                allow users under the minimum age to create an account.

                Age is verified locally on your device during signup; we do not collect or store your date of birth.

                If you are a parent or guardian and believe a child under 16 has created an account, contact us at
                zernoxi6@gmail.com
                to have it deleted.</p>

            <h2>10. Other Important Notes</h2>
            <p><strong>Data Retention:</strong> We retain your personal data only as long as necessary to provide the
                app services or as required by law. When you delete your account, we will remove your data from our
                systems promptly (typically within minutes, and within 30 days at most), except for any data we are
                legally required to keep (such as anonymized logs).</p>

            <p><strong>AI Accuracy:</strong> Our AI features (car identification) are designed to assist you,
                but they are not 100% accurate. Results should be treated as probabilistic; always verify important
                information manually.</p>

            <p><strong>Local vs. Cloud Processing:</strong> Blurring (including manual blur) and watermarking happen on
                your device. Photos you upload or share are processed locally first (blurred/watermarked as applicable),
                and we receive/store the processed result. Automatic blurring is best-effort; if it misses something,
                you are responsible for reviewing your photos and using the in-app manual blur tool before uploading.
                Third-party servers are used for authentication, data storage, and optional AI identification if you
                opt in.</p>

            <p><strong>Originality Detection:</strong> During photo upload, we analyze photo metadata (EXIF data
                including camera information, GPS data, and timestamps) locally on your device to detect screenshots or
                downloaded images. This helps prevent non-original photos from appearing in the public feed and Country
                Spots. Photos flagged as non-original are still added to your car collection and visible to friends, but
                are automatically hidden from public sharing. If administrators later identify a photo as non-original,
                it may be deleted from our servers.</p>

            <h2>11. Data Protection and International Transfers</h2>
            <p><strong>Data Protection:</strong> We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to
                protect your data against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. This includes
                encrypted transmission (HTTPS/TLS), encrypted storage by our service providers (such as Firebase/Google
                Cloud), secure authentication, and access controls.</p>

            <p><strong>Security Limitation:</strong> While we implement reasonable and industry-standard security
                measures to protect your information, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of
                electronic storage is completely secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee absolute security of your
                data.</p>

            <p><strong>International Transfers:</strong> Your data may be processed in countries other than your own
                (for example, on servers operated by Google or other service providers worldwide). In such cases, we
                ensure appropriate safeguards (such as compliance with EU Standard Contractual Clauses or similar
                measures) are in place to protect your data.</p>

            <p><strong>Legal Basis:</strong> If you are an EU resident (GDPR), we rely on the following legal grounds
                for processing:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Consent:</strong> When you give explicit permission (e.g., enabling location services).</li>
                <li><strong>Contract Performance:</strong> To perform the services you request (e.g., providing access
                    to your account and collection).</li>
                <li><strong>Legitimate Interests:</strong> For app functionality, security, and improvement, balancing
                    our interests against your privacy rights.</li>
                <li><strong>Legal Compliance:</strong> To comply with laws and regulatory obligations.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>12. GDPR and CCPA Rights</h2>
            <p>We comply with applicable privacy laws, including GDPR and CCPA.</p>

            <p><strong>EU (GDPR) Rights:</strong> If you reside in the European Economic Area, you have rights under
                GDPR, including the right to access, correct, or delete your personal data; the right to restrict or
                object to certain processing; the right to data portability; and the right to withdraw consent at any
                time. You may also lodge a complaint with a data protection authority. To exercise these rights, please
                contact us (see below).</p>

            <p><strong>California (CCPA) Rights:</strong> California residents have the right to know what personal data
                is collected and how it is used, the right to request deletion of personal data, and the right to opt
                out of the sale of personal data. AutoSpotterX does not sell your personal information (ever) – this is
                a permanent, unchangeable policy. If you wish to request deletion or disclosure of your data, please
                contact us.</p>

            <h2>14. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time (for example, when adding new features or services).
                When we make changes, we will update the "Last Updated" date at the bottom of this page and, where
                appropriate, provide a notice in the app. Continuing to use AutoSpotterX after changes are posted
                constitutes your acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy.</p>
