            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>AutoSpotterX ("we," "our," or "us") values your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect,
                use, and protect your information when you use the AutoSpotterX mobile app (available on Google Play).
                It applies to all users of the app and covers the data collected through the app.</p>

            <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>We collect the following types of information:</p>

            <p><strong>Account & Profile Data:</strong> Username, optional profile photo, account creation date, AutoXP
                points, and optional bio. Authentication is handled by Firebase Authentication (email/password or Google
                sign-in). We also store whether you accepted our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy (including acceptance date/version). Your email address is used only for authentication.
            <p>

            <p><strong>User Content:</strong> Vehicle photos (low-quality thumbnails stored in Firebase and high-quality
                photos stored in Cloudinary for feed display), car make/model information (entered manually or via AI
                detection), AI detection confidence scores, AI identification usage count (tracked in Firebase to
                enforce free usage limits), notes/captions, timestamps, optional GPS coordinates (stored only on your
                device - see Section 6.1), country name/code (derived from coordinates), likes (your user ID when you
                like posts), privacy settings, friend connections and requests (including friend request status,
                timestamps, and email addresses for pending invitations), notifications (including like notifications
                with liker information and car details, friend request notifications with requester information, and
                system notifications), and reports (when you report content).</p>


            <p><strong>Device & Usage Data:</strong> Technical data from your device, such as device model and operating
                system version, to ensure compatibility and diagnose issues. We may also collect usage statistics to
                improve the app.</p>

                (for mapping features), Internet (for cloud sync), and Network State (to check connectivity). You can
                change or revoke permissions through your device settings.</p>

            <h2>3. Third-Party Services and Partners</h2>
            <p>AutoSpotterX uses third-party services (each has its own privacy policy):</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Firebase (Google):</strong> User accounts, database storage, and backend services. (<a
                        href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>)</li>
                <li><strong>Google ML Kit:</strong> On-device license plate and face blurring. (<a
                        href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>)</li>
                <li><strong>Google Gemini API:</strong> Optional AI car identification. Only the photo is sent to Google
                    for identification. Data handling is subject to Google's Privacy Policy. Limited free uses per
                    account. We track your usage count in Firebase to enforce usage limits. (<a
                        href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>)</li>
                <li><strong>Google Geocoding Service:</strong> Converts GPS coordinates to country name/code.
                    Coordinates are sent to Google for lookup (may be collected per Google's Privacy Policy). Only
                    country info is stored in our database. (<a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy"
                        target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>)</li>
                <li><strong>Cloudinary:</strong> High-quality photo storage and delivery for the public feed. We store
                    high-quality versions of your car photos on Cloudinary (in addition to low-quality thumbnails in
                    Firebase) to provide better image quality in the feed. High-quality photos are only uploaded to
                    Cloudinary if the car appears in the public feed (not hidden by privacy settings or rarity
                    restrictions). High-quality photos may be periodically deleted from Cloudinary for storage
                    management, but low-quality thumbnails remain in Firebase. (<a href="https://cloudinary.com/privacy"
                        target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>)</li>
                <li><strong>MapTiler:</strong> Map tiles (no access to your location data). (<a
                        href="https://www.maptiler.com/privacy-policy/" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>)</li>
                <li><strong>MapLibre GL:</strong> Map rendering (runs entirely on your device).</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. How We Use Your Information</h2>
            <p>We use your information to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Account Management:</strong> Create and maintain your account and profile.</li>
                <li><strong>Feature Functionality:</strong> Process photos (AI detection, blurring, originality
                    detection), manage your car collection, and store spotting data. Photo originality detection
                    analyzes photo metadata (EXIF data) on your device to detect if photos are original or
                    downloaded/screenshots. This analysis happens entirely on your device—no photo data or information
                    is sent to external servers. Photos detected as non-original will not appear in the public feed or
                    Country Spots screen.</li>
                <li><strong>Public Feed:</strong> Display your shared cars in the feed (photo, make/model, likes,
                    country, display name).</li>
                <li><strong>Country Discovery:</strong> Power Country Spots browsing using country codes.</li>
                <li><strong>Likes and Interactions:</strong> Track likes, display counts, and send notifications when
                    someone likes your car.</li>
                <li><strong>Friend Connections:</strong> Manage friends, friend requests, and allow viewing friends'
                    collections.</li>
                <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> Send in-app notifications (likes, friend requests, system updates).
                </li>
                <li><strong>Content Moderation:</strong> Review and moderate reported content. Delete non-compliant
                    content from our servers (Firestore and Cloudinary) when it violates our Terms of Service. Notify
                    users when their content is removed for policy violations.</li>
                <li><strong>Gamification:</strong> Calculate AutoXP points to unlock features, display XP ranks (Newbie,
                    Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, Expert, Master, Legend), and power leaderboard rankings (top 50
                    users by AutoXP, showing username, profile photo, and XP).</li>
                <li><strong>AI Services:</strong> Provide car identification via Google Gemini. Usage count is tracked
                    in Firebase (geminiUsage collection) to enforce free usage limits.</li>
                <li><strong>Privacy Controls:</strong> Respect your feed visibility preferences.</li>
                <li><strong>Mapping:</strong> Display car locations on your personal map (coordinates stored locally -
                    see Section 6.1).</li>
                <li><strong>App Improvement:</strong> Analyze anonymous vehicle data to improve car specifications
                    database.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Data Security and Storage</h2>
            <p>We protect your data with:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Secure Servers:</strong> Encrypted transmission (HTTPS/TLS) and encrypted storage on
                    Firebase/Google Cloud.</li>
                <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> Secure password authentication (passwords never stored in plain
                    text).</li>
                <li><strong>Local Processing:</strong> Car detection, blurring, and watermarking done on your device.
                    Original images stay on your device.</li>

                    form (AES256-GCM encryption). GPS coordinates stored only on your device in app-private storage
                    (protected by Android file system permissions, never uploaded). See Section 6.1 for location
                    details.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>6. Data Sharing</h2>
            <p>We never sell your personal information. Data sharing is limited to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> We engage third-party service providers ("Service Providers") to
                    facilitate our services, provide services on our behalf, perform service-related tasks, or assist us
                    in analyzing how our services are used. These Service Providers include:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Firebase (Google):</strong> For user authentication, database storage, and backend
                            services. We share username, profile data (profile photo, bio, AutoXP points, account
                            creation
                            date), car collection data, and app usage data. Email is stored in Firebase Authentication
                            only
                            for login purposes and is not shared with our Firestore database or other users.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cloudinary:</strong> For high-quality photo storage and delivery in the public feed.
                            We share high-quality versions of uploaded vehicle photos for feed display. High-quality
                            photos are only uploaded to Cloudinary if the car appears in the public feed (not hidden by
                            privacy settings or rarity restrictions). High-quality photos may be periodically deleted
                            from Cloudinary for storage management.</li>
                        <li><strong>Google Services (ML Kit, Gemini API, Geocoding):</strong> For on-device processing,
                            optional AI identification, and geocoding services. Data shared is limited to what is
                            necessary for each service (see Section 3 for details).</li>
                        <li><strong>MapTiler:</strong> For map tile services. We do not share personal location data
                            with MapTiler, only anonymous map tile requests.</li>
                    </ul>

                </li>
                <li><strong>Law and Safety:</strong> We may disclose your information if required by law (such as a
                    valid subpoena or court order), to comply with legal obligations, or to protect our rights, safety,
                    or property, or that of our users or others.</li>
                <li><strong>Friends:</strong> Friends can see your car collection and profile photo. User IDs are used
                    internally for app functionality (such as managing friendships and navigation) but are not displayed
                    in the UI. They cannot see your location data (see Section 6.1).</li>
                <li><strong>Public Feed:</strong> When you share a car to the public feed (not hidden by privacy
                    settings or rarity restrictions), all users can see: car photo, make/model, like count, country
                    name,
                    timestamp, caption/notes, your display name/profile photo, and AutoXP rank. Exact location is never
                    shown—only country name.</li>
                <li><strong>Country Spots Screen:</strong> Users can browse RARE+ cars by country. Your car photo and
                    make/model are visible. Username/profile info is not shown. Only country name is displayed—no exact
                    location. Only RARE+ cars that were not hidden from the feed appear in country browsing.</li>
                <li><strong>Like Notifications:</strong> When you like someone's car, the person who spotted the car
                    will receive a notification showing that you liked their car (e.g., "Ron liked your Ferrari F40").
                    The notification includes only your username and car details. Your user ID is used internally for
                    app functionality but is not displayed in the UI.</li>
                <li><strong>Friend Requests:</strong> When you send a friend request to someone (including through the
                    feed and leaderboard), the recipient can see your display name and profile photo in the Friends
                    screen where they can accept or reject the request. They will also receive a notification (e.g.,
                    "John sent you a friend request"). Your user ID is used internally for app functionality but is not
                    displayed in the UI. No other personal data is shared.</li>
                <li><strong>Administrators:</strong> Can access user data (photos, profile information, content) for
                    moderation/support. Administrators can delete car photos/spots that do not comply with our Terms of
                    Service. When administrators delete content, it is permanently removed from our servers (Firestore
                    and Cloudinary). Users will be notified via in-app notification when their content is deleted by
                    administrators. Administrators may also hide content from the public feed if content violates
                    policies. Location coordinates are never accessible to administrators (stored only on your device -
                    see Section 6.1).</li>
                <li><strong>Leaderboard:</strong> The app includes a public leaderboard showing the top 50 users by
                    AutoXP. This displays only username, AutoXP points, and profile photo. User IDs are used internally
                    for app functionality (such as sending friend requests) but are not displayed in the UI. All users
                    can view the leaderboard in the Friends screen. Email addresses are never displayed in the
                    leaderboard.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>6.1 Map and Location Privacy</h2>
            <p>Your location privacy is fully protected:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Device-Only Storage:</strong> GPS coordinates are stored only on your device in
                    SharedPreferences.
                    Never uploaded to our servers. Deleted when you uninstall the app or delete your account.</li>
                <li><strong>Country Data Only:</strong> To enable Country Spots browsing and show which country a car
                    was
                    spotted in, we extract country name/code from coordinates using Google Geocoding (coordinates sent
                    temporarily to Google). Only country name/code is stored on our servers—exact coordinates are not.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Completely Private:</strong> Only you can see exact locations on your personal map. Friends
                    can see your car photos/details but not locations or map markers.</li>
            </ul>


            <h2>6.2 Content Licensing and Promotion</h2>
            <p>By sharing content in the App, you grant AutoSpotterX a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to
                use, reproduce, display, and distribute your content (including photos, captions, and vehicle
                information) for promotional and marketing purposes, including but not limited to:</p>

            <p>This license applies to content you share publicly in the App (such as posts in the public feed). When we
                use your content for promotional purposes, we will credit you by your display name or username when
                feasible and appropriate. To opt out of promotional use, disable sharing to the public feed in your
                privacy settings (Settings → Privacy → "Don't Upload to Feed & Country Spots") or hide individual cars
                when uploading.
                Content that is not shared publicly will not be used for promotional purposes.</p>
            <p>This license is limited to uses necessary to operate, improve, and promote AutoSpotterX, and does not
                transfer ownership of the content to AutoSpotterX.</p>

            <h2>7. Your Rights and Controls</h2>
            <p>You have control over your personal data and account. You can view and update your profile information,
                delete your photos or entries, request data export, manage friends, control app permissions through
                device settings, and opt out of non-essential communications.</p>
            <p><strong>Data Export:</strong>You can export your data through app settings in a ZIP file, including your profile, cars and media (with location, photos, and videos), friends, notifications, and AI usage counts.</p>

            <h2>8. Account and Data Deletion</h2>
            <p>You can delete your entire account through app settings (deleted immediately, typically within minutes)
                or by emailing us at zernoxi6@gmail.com with "Account Deletion" in the subject line (deleted within 7
                working days). All personal data will be permanently deleted. Deleting individual photos or entries
                removes that content from our servers immediately. Deletion covers all personal data including profile
                info, photos, videos, car collection details, friend connections, and activity logs.</p>
            <p><strong>Administrative Deletion:</strong> Content may also be deleted by administrators if it violates
                our Terms of Service. When administrators delete your content for policy violations, it is permanently
                removed from our servers (Firestore and Cloudinary). You will be notified via in-app notification if
                your content is deleted for policy violations.</p>

            <h2>9. Additional (Optional) Features</h2>
            <p>AutoSpotterX offers several optional features with extra privacy considerations:</p>

            <p><strong>On-Device Detection:</strong> The app includes privacy blurring (for
                license plates and faces) using Google ML Kit on your device. All processing occurs locally, and
                original images remain on your device. We do not send your photos to external servers for this feature.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Local Video Storage:</strong> If you record car videos within the app, they are stored only on
                your device in encrypted form (using AES-GCM). These videos are never uploaded or shared externally.
                Deleting the associated car entry or your account will erase these videos.</p>

            <p><strong>Cloud AI Identification:</strong> As mentioned in Section 3, the optional Google Gemini service
                can analyze car photos. This is an opt-in feature: you must choose to send a photo to Google for
                identification. Only the image is sent (no personal data). Data handling is subject to Google's Privacy
                Policy. We track your usage count in Firebase to enforce free usage limits.</p>

            <p><strong>Friends & Collection Sharing:</strong> If you connect with other users, you can view each other's
                car collections and profile photos in the app. Friends cannot see your precise car locations or any
                additional personal data beyond what you've shared (such as display name and avatar). See Section 6.1
                for location privacy details.</p>

            <p><strong>Public Spot Feed:</strong> (See Section 9.3 below.)</p>

            <h2>9.1 Photo Reporting System</h2>
            <p>Users can report photos that violate our Terms of Service. When you report content, we collect your user
                ID, the reported content's ID, and the reason. Our admin team reviews reports and takes appropriate
                action. When content is reported and found to violate our Terms of Service, it will be deleted from the
                app and our servers (Firestore and Cloudinary). Users whose content is deleted will be notified via
                in-app notification. Content may be deleted immediately upon review if it violates our policies. Your
                identity as the reporter is kept confidential. Report records are kept for moderation purposes only.</p>

            <h2>9.2 Photo Watermarking</h2>
            <p>All photos are automatically watermarked with "AutoSpotterX" for branding and content protection.
                Watermarking is done locally on your device and cannot be disabled.</p>

            <h2>9.3 Public Spot Feed</h2>
            <p>The Spot Feed is an optional community feature where users can share and browse car sightings. Feed posts
                show your car photo (high-quality from Cloudinary), make/model, like count, country name, timestamp,
                caption/notes (if provided), display name/profile photo, and AutoXP rank. Your user ID is used
                internally but not displayed. Exact location data is never shown only country name (see Section 6.1).
            </p>
            <p><strong>Upload & Visibility:</strong> Low-quality thumbnails are stored in Firebase. High-quality photos
                upload to Cloudinary only when cars appear in the feed. All users can only share RARE+ cars to the Feed
                & Country Spots,
                uncommon cars are automatically hidden. You can prevent uploading cars via Settings → Privacy → "Don't
                Upload to Feed & Country Spots" (prevents all car uploads) or by toggling "Hide from Feed & Country
                Spots" when spotting (prevents
                individual cars). Privacy settings take precedence over rarity restrictions.</p>
            <p><strong>Interactions:</strong> Other users can like or report your posts. You'll receive notifications
                when someone likes your car.</p>

            <h2>9.4 Country Browsing Feature</h2>
            <p>AutoSpotterX includes a "Country Spots" feature that allows users to browse car sightings organized by
                country. This feature shows only country-level location data, no precise GPS coordinates or street
                addresses (see Section 6.1). Users can see car photos and make/model details, but usernames and profile
                information are not displayed. Only RARE+ cars that were not hidden by the user when uploading appear in
                country browsing. Country codes are derived from coordinates and stored, but exact coordinates remain on
                your device.</p>

            <h2>10. Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>You must be at least 16 years old to use AutoSpotterX (age may vary by local law). We do not knowingly allow users under the minimum age to create an account.

                Age is verified locally on your device during signup; we do not collect or store your date of birth.

                If you are a parent or guardian and believe a child under 16 has created an account, contact us at zernoxi6@gmail.com
                to have it deleted.</p>

            <h2>11. Other Important Notes</h2>
            <p><strong>Data Retention:</strong> We retain your personal data only as long as necessary to provide the
                app services or as required by law. When you delete your account, we will remove your data from our
                systems immediately (typically within minutes, and within 30 days at most), except for any data we are
                legally required to keep (such as anonymized logs).</p>

            <p><strong>AI Accuracy:</strong> Our AI features (car detection, identification) are designed to assist you,
                but they are not 100% accurate. Results should be treated as probabilistic; always verify important
                information manually.</p>

            <p><strong>Local vs. Cloud Processing:</strong> Most sensitive processing (e.g., blurring, watermarking)
                happens on your device. Third-party servers (e.g., Google/Cloud services) are only used for
                authentication, data storage, and optional AI identification if you opt in.</p>


            <h2>12. Data Protection and International Transfers</h2>
            <p><strong>Data Protection:</strong> We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to
                protect your data against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. This includes
                using encryption, secure authentication, and access controls.</p>

            <p><strong>International Transfers:</strong> Your data may be processed in countries other than your own
                (for example, on servers operated by Google or other service providers worldwide). In such cases, we
                ensure appropriate safeguards (such as compliance with EU Standard Contractual Clauses or similar
                measures) are in place to protect your data.</p>

            <p><strong>Legal Basis:</strong> If you are an EU resident (GDPR), we rely on the following legal grounds
                for processing:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Consent:</strong> When you give explicit permission (e.g., enabling location services).</li>
                <li><strong>Contract Performance:</strong> To perform the services you request (e.g., providing access
                    to your account and collection).</li>
                <li><strong>Legitimate Interests:</strong> For app functionality, security, and improvement, balancing
                    our interests against your privacy rights.</li>
                <li><strong>Legal Compliance:</strong> To comply with laws and regulatory obligations.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>13. GDPR and CCPA Rights</h2>
            <p>We comply with applicable privacy laws, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and
                the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA):</p>

            <p><strong>EU (GDPR) Rights:</strong> If you reside in the European Economic Area, you have rights under
                GDPR, including the right to access, correct, or delete your personal data; the right to restrict or
                object to certain processing; the right to data portability; and the right to withdraw consent at any
                time. You may also lodge a complaint with a data protection authority. To exercise these rights, please
                contact us (see below).</p>

            <p><strong>California (CCPA) Rights:</strong> California residents have the right to know what personal data
                is collected and how it is used, the right to request deletion of personal data, and the right to opt
                out of the sale of personal data. AutoSpotterX does not sell your personal information (ever) – this is
                a permanent, unchangeable policy. If you wish to request deletion or disclosure of your data, please
                contact us.</p>

            <h2>15. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time (for example, when adding new features or services).
                When we make changes, we will update the "Last Updated" date at the bottom of this page and, where

                constitutes your acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy.</p>
